## Introduction

In Spark, data isn't stored persistently in the cluster; once the cluster is terminated, all data disappears unless saved elsewhere. Spark provides mechanisms to persist data using **tables and views**, with further distinctions between **managed** and **unmanaged tables**. Understanding these concepts is essential for designing robust data pipelines. In this blog, we’ll explore how to use tables and views, their differences, and when to choose managed versus unmanaged tables.

## Tables vs. Views in Spark

### **Tables**
- A **table** stores data persistently in a database.
- Data is written to a storage location (e.g., Databricks File System or S3), and metadata is saved in the **Hive Metastore**.
- Tables offer faster read performance since the data is precomputed and stored.

### **Views**
- A **view** is essentially a stored query.
- Data is not saved; instead, the query is executed every time the view is accessed.
- Views are ideal for dynamic data that changes frequently.

### **Performance Comparison**
To demonstrate the difference, we performed two operations:
1. **Temporary View**:
   - Query Execution Time: ~9.17 seconds.
2. **Table**:
   - Query Execution Time: ~1.3 seconds.

The table performed significantly faster because the data was already saved, whereas the view required recalculating the query each time.

## Types of Views in Spark

1. **Temporary Views**:
   - Scope: Limited to the notebook or session.
   - Disappears when the session or cluster ends.
   - Example:
     ```python
     df.createOrReplaceTempView("temp_view")
     ```

2. **Global Views**:
   - Scope: Available across all clusters within the same workspace.
   - Stored in the Hive Metastore.
   - Example:
     ```python
     df.createOrReplaceGlobalTempView("global_view")
     ```

## Managed vs. Unmanaged Tables

### **Managed Tables**
- **Definition**: Spark manages both the metadata (schema) and the underlying data.
- **Behavior**:
  - Dropping the table removes both metadata and data.
  - Ideal for ephemeral or temporary data.
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE managed_table (
      id INT,
      name STRING
  );
  INSERT INTO managed_table VALUES (1, 'Alice'), (2, 'Bob');
  ```

- **Dropping the Table**:
  Dropping a managed table deletes the underlying files:
  ```sql
  DROP TABLE managed_table;
  ```

### **Unmanaged Tables**
- **Definition**: Spark manages only the metadata, while the data resides in an external location.
- **Behavior**:
  - Dropping the table removes only the metadata, leaving the data intact.
  - Suitable for persistent data that needs to exist independently of Spark.
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE unmanaged_table (
      id INT,
      name STRING
  )
  USING parquet
  LOCATION 's3://my-bucket/unmanaged_table';
  INSERT INTO unmanaged_table VALUES (3, 'Charlie'), (4, 'Diana');
  ```

- **Dropping the Table**:
  Dropping an unmanaged table retains the underlying files:
  ```sql
  DROP TABLE unmanaged_table;
  ```

## Practical Demonstration

### **Managed Table**
1. Create and insert data:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE managed_table (
       id INT,
       value STRING
   );
   INSERT INTO managed_table VALUES (1, 'one'), (2, 'two');
   ```

2. Check metadata and data:
   ```sql
   DESCRIBE EXTENDED managed_table;
   ```

3. Drop the table and verify:
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE managed_table;
   %fs ls /path/to/managed_table  -- Expect FileNotFoundException
   ```

### **Unmanaged Table**
1. Create and insert data:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE unmanaged_table (
       id INT,
       value STRING
   )
   USING parquet
   LOCATION '/mnt/external/unmanaged_table';
   INSERT INTO unmanaged_table VALUES (3, 'three'), (4, 'four');
   ```

2. Drop the table and verify:
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE unmanaged_table;
   %fs ls /mnt/external/unmanaged_table  -- Files remain intact
   ```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Choose Between Tables and Views**:
   - Use **tables** for faster queries where data doesn’t change frequently.
   - Use **views** for dynamic data or queries that need to reflect the latest data.

2. **Decide on Managed vs. Unmanaged Tables**:
   - Use **managed tables** when you want Spark to handle both metadata and data lifecycle.
   - Use **unmanaged tables** for persistent storage in external systems like S3 or Azure Blob.

3. **Understand Dropping Behavior**:
   - Dropping a managed table deletes both data and metadata.
   - Dropping an unmanaged table deletes only metadata, leaving data intact.
