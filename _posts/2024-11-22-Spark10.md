## Introduction

Databricks allows seamless integration of data for analysis by supporting various import methods. This guide demonstrates how to import a local CSV file into Databricks and preview the dataset in a table.

---

## Step 1: Start with "Create Table"

To begin, navigate to the Databricks home page and click **Create Table** under the **Import and Transform Data** section.

This action will take you to the interface for importing files and configuring tables.

## Step 2: Choose the CSV File to Upload

In the **Data Source** section:

1. Select **Upload File**.
2. Choose the **DBFS Target Directory** where your file will be stored.
3. Click **Select** to upload your local CSV file.
4. Once uploaded, the file will appear in the list with a confirmation message.

## Step 3: Select a Cluster to Preview the Table

To preview the data, you need to associate the table with a running cluster:

1. Select a cluster from the **Cluster** dropdown.
2. If no cluster is running, start one by clicking **Create Cluster** from the top-right corner.

## Step 4: Configure Table Settings

After uploading the file:

1. Click **Create Table with UI** to start configuring the table.
2. In the **Specify Table Attributes** section, set the following:
   - **Table Name**: Provide a unique name for your table.
   - **File Type**: Ensure CSV is selected.
   - **Column Delimiter**: Choose the appropriate delimiter (e.g., `,` for CSV).
   - **First Row is Header**: Check this option if your file includes headers.
   - **Infer Schema**: Check this to allow Databricks to detect data types automatically.

## Step 5: Preview the Table and Finalize Table Creation

Click **Preview Table** to load the dataset and view its structure. This preview allows you to validate the configuration and check the schema before finalizing the table creation.

After previewing the table, click **Create Table**. Databricks will save the table in the database for further analysis using SQL or other programming languages.

## Step 6: Verify the Table in Catalog

Once the table is created, navigate to the **Catalog** section on the left sidebar to ensure that the table has been successfully added to the database.

1. Under **Databases**, expand the `default` database (or the one you chose during table creation).
2. Verify that your table appears in the list of tables. In this example, the table is named `household_csv`.

This confirms that the table is now part of the Databricks environment and ready for analysis.

## Step 7: Query the Table in a Notebook

To analyze the data, you can write SQL queries in a Databricks notebook. Follow these steps to start querying:

1. From the **New** menu on the left sidebar, select **Notebook**.
2. Provide a name for your notebook (e.g., "Household Data Analysis") and choose SQL as the default language.

3. Open the notebook and run the following SQL query to display the first 10 rows of the table:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM household_csv LIMIT 10;
   ```

4. The query results will display a preview of the dataset, including the rows and columns imported from the CSV file.

## Important Considerations for Querying
When writing SQL queries, ensure that you handle column names with spaces properly. If any column name includes spaces or special characters, you must enclose it in backticks (`). For example:

```sql
SELECT `Column Name With Spaces` 
FROM household_csv;
```
