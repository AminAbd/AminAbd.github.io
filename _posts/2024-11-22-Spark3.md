## What is PySpark?

PySpark is the Python interface for Apache Spark, a distributed data processing framework designed for scalability and speed. Spark provides capabilities for batch processing, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and graph computations, all accessible through PySpark. With its intuitive syntax and integration with Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy, PySpark simplifies big data analysis.

### Initializing a Spark Session in PySpark

A **SparkSession** is the entry point to PySpark. It allows you to interact with Spark and create DataFrames, RDDs, and perform operations on them. The `SparkSession` class provides a unified interface for managing resources and executing Spark applications.

To initialize a SparkSession in PySpark, use the following code:

```
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create a SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName('Practise').getOrCreate()

# Display the SparkSession details
spark
```

### What is a SparkSession?
A `SparkSession` is the central object in PySpark that manages the lifecycle of your Spark application.
It allows you to:
- Access Sparkâ€™s capabilities such as SQL, DataFrame, and Streaming APIs.
- Manage the Spark context, configuration, and resources.
- Create or retrieve existing Spark applications.

### Reading and Displaying Data with PySpark

Once the SparkSession is created, you can use it to read and process data. PySpark provides simple methods to load data from various sources, such as CSV, JSON, and Parquet.

#### Example: Reading a CSV File
Suppose you have a CSV file named file1.csv. Here's how you can read and display it using PySpark:
```
# Read a CSV file into a DataFrame
df_pyspark = spark.read.csv('file1.csv')

# Display the first 20 rows of the DataFrame
df_pyspark.show()
```

#### What does `df.show()` do?
- `df.show()` displays the top rows of the DataFrame in a tabular format, similar to `head()` in Pandas.
- By default, it shows the first 20 rows. You can customize the number of rows to display by passing an argument:

```
df_pyspark.show(10)  # Display the first 10 rows
```
- This is a quick way to preview your data and ensure it has been loaded correctly.

#### Reading CSV with Headers

- To load a CSV file that contains column headers, you can use the option() method:

```
df_pyspark = spark.read.option('header', 'true').csv('file1.csv')
df_pyspark.show()
```
- header=true tells PySpark to treat the first row of the file as column headers instead of data.

### Checking the Schema of a DataFrame
After loading the data, you may want to inspect its structure, such as column names and data types. Use the `printSchema()` method:

```
df_pyspark.printSchema()
```
What does `df.printSchema()` do?
- Displays the schema (column names and data types) of the DataFrame.
- This is especially useful when working with large or complex datasets where you want to confirm data types before further processing.
