## Introduction

Adaptive Query Execution (AQE) is a powerful feature introduced in Spark 3.0 to dynamically optimize query execution plans at runtime. Traditional query execution in Spark relies on static plans, which can be suboptimal when faced with data skew, varying partition sizes, or unexpected workloads. AQE overcomes these challenges by using real-time statistics to adjust execution plans, making it ideal for dynamic, exploratory, and large-scale workloads.

In this blog, weâ€™ll dive deep into the mechanics of AQE, explore its key features, and demonstrate how it can significantly improve query performance.

## How Query Execution Worked Before AQE

Before AQE, Spark used a **cost-based optimization (CBO)** approach within the Catalyst optimizer to create execution plans. This process involved:

1. Parsing SQL or DataFrame code into an **unresolved logical plan**.
2. Resolving the plan by looking up data types and column references in a catalog.
3. Applying logical optimizations, such as predicate pushdown (e.g., moving filters closer to the data source).
4. Generating one or more physical plans, scoring them using a cost model, and selecting the best one.

While effective, this static approach had limitations:
- **Stale or Missing Statistics**: Incorrect data estimates could lead to suboptimal plans.
- **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**: UDFs appeared as black boxes, preventing Catalyst from optimizing around them.
- **Rapidly Evolving Data**: Static plans struggled with dynamic datasets.

## What is Adaptive Query Execution?

AQE introduces **adaptive planning**, which re-optimizes query execution plans during runtime based on actual data characteristics. This dynamic adjustment occurs at stage boundaries, leveraging runtime statistics to improve efficiency.

### Key Features of AQE

1. **Dynamic Shuffle Partitioning**:
   - Adjusts the number of partitions based on the size of intermediate data to balance workloads and minimize shuffle overhead.

2. **Dynamic Join Strategies**:
   - Switches between join types (e.g., sort-merge join and broadcast join) based on runtime data size.

3. **Skew Join Optimization**:
   - Detects and mitigates data skew by splitting large partitions into smaller sub-partitions.

## How Adaptive Query Execution Works

AQE operates by re-evaluating the unexecuted portion of a query plan at each stage boundary. If optimizations are possible, AQE adjusts the plan dynamically and continues execution. This process repeats until all stages are complete.

### Framework:
1. Executes **leaf stages** (stages with no dependencies) to collect accurate statistics.
2. Analyzes runtime metrics (e.g., partition sizes, data distribution).
3. Dynamically adjusts shuffle partitions, join strategies, or skewed partitions.

## Key Features of AQE in Detail

### 1. Dynamic Shuffle Partitioning
Static partitioning requires setting a fixed number of shuffle partitions (`spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`) for the entire query. This can result in:
- **Too Many Partitions**: Small tasks and scheduling overhead.
- **Too Few Partitions**: Memory bottlenecks and uneven workloads.

AQE dynamically adjusts the number of shuffle partitions during execution based on intermediate data sizes. For example:
- If data volumes are small, partitions are **coalesced** into fewer, larger partitions.
- If data volumes are large, partitions are **increased** to distribute the workload evenly.

#### Example:
```python
# Default configuration
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", 200)

# Enable AQE
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.adaptive.enabled", "true")
```

---

### 2. Dynamic Join Strategies
Spark offers multiple join strategies:
- **Sort-Merge Join**: Shuffles and sorts both datasets, suitable for large datasets.
- **Broadcast Join**: Broadcasts a small dataset to all executors, avoiding shuffle.

Before AQE, join strategies were determined at query planning based on estimated dataset sizes. AQE enables Spark to re-evaluate these estimates at runtime, switching to a broadcast join if a dataset is smaller than the broadcast threshold.

#### Example:
```python
# Enable AQE
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.adaptive.enabled", "true")

# Adjust broadcast join threshold
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold", "10MB")
```

---

### 3. Skew Join Optimization
Data skew occurs when certain keys in a dataset have disproportionately large values, causing uneven workloads across tasks. AQE detects skewed partitions at runtime and splits them into smaller sub-partitions, distributing the workload more evenly.

#### Example:
```python
# Enable skew join optimization
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.adaptive.skewJoin.enabled", "true")
```

## Example Workflow with AQE

### Without AQE
```python
# Static configuration
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", 200)

df.groupBy("key").agg({"value": "sum"}).show()
```

### With AQE
```python
# Enable AQE
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.adaptive.enabled", "true")

# Dynamic shuffle partitioning
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.adaptive.shuffle.targetPostShuffleInputSize", "64MB")

df.groupBy("key").agg({"value": "sum"}).show()
```

## Monitoring AQE in Spark UI

The **Spark UI** provides detailed insights into AQE optimizations:

1. **Stages Tab**:
   - Shows stage boundaries where AQE applied optimizations.
2. **SQL Tab**:
   - Displays dynamically updated execution plans.
3. **Task Metrics**:
   - Highlights improvements in task durations and resource utilization.

---

## Benefits of AQE

1. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Reduces shuffle overhead.
   - Speeds up joins and aggregations.

2. **Efficient Resource Utilization**:
   - Balances workloads across partitions and executors.

3. **Reduced Manual Tuning**:
   - Minimizes the need to configure shuffle partitions or join strategies manually.

---

## Limitations of AQE

While AQE is a powerful feature, it has some limitations:
- **Overhead**: Frequent re-optimizations can introduce minor runtime overhead for small jobs.
- **Compatibility**: Certain operations or legacy features may not fully leverage AQE.

---

## Best Practices for AQE

1. **Enable AQE for Complex Workloads**:
   - Use AQE for queries involving joins, aggregations, or large data volumes.

2. **Fine-Tune Configurations**:
   - Adjust parameters like shuffle target size and broadcast thresholds for better results.

3. **Leverage the Spark UI**:
   - Analyze query plans and task metrics to validate AQE optimizations.

## Conclusion

Adaptive Query Execution (AQE) revolutionizes query optimization in Spark by dynamically adjusting execution plans based on runtime statistics. It simplifies tuning, improves performance, and ensures efficient resource utilization, making it indispensable for modern data processing workloads.

Whether you're dealing with skewed data, large-scale joins, or dynamic partitioning challenges, AQE provides the tools to handle them effectively. Enable AQE in your next Spark job and experience the power of real-time query optimization!
