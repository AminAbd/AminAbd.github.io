## Introduction

Databricks is a comprehensive platform for big data processing and machine learning. This guide walks you through setting up and using Databricks Community Edition step by step, with corresponding screenshots for clarity.

## Step 1: Setting Up a Database and Table

To analyze data in Databricks, we first need to set up a database and create a table.

### SQL Code:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS Databricks;
USE Databricks;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS fireCalls
USING csv
OPTIONS (
  header "true",
  path "dbfs:/databricks-datasets/learning-spark-v2/sf-fire/sf-fire-calls.csv",
  inferSchema "true"
);
```
This code creates a database named Databricks and imports the SF Fire Department Calls dataset as a table called fireCalls.



## Step 2: Viewing the Data
After creating the table, we can query the dataset to take a look at its structure and contents.

```sql
SELECT * FROM fireCalls LIMIT 10;
```
This query retrieves the first 10 rows of the dataset, helping you understand its structure.

## Step 3: Understanding the Table Schema
You can use the DESCRIBE TABLE command to view the schema of the fireCalls table, which includes column names, data types, and comments.


```sql
DESCRIBE TABLE fireCalls;
```
This provides a detailed view of the table’s structure.

## Step 4: Analyzing Neighborhoods with the Most Fire Calls
To identify which neighborhoods reported the most fire calls, we can execute a SQL query that groups the data by neighborhoods and counts the number of calls.


```sql
SELECT `Neighborhood` AS neighborhood, 
       COUNT(`Neighborhood`) AS count 
FROM fireCalls 
GROUP BY `Neighborhood`
ORDER BY count DESC;
```
This query returns the top neighborhoods with the highest number of fire calls, ordered by the count.

## Step 5: Visualizing Neighborhood Fire Call Counts
Databricks provides built-in visualization tools to transform raw query results into insightful visual representations. Here’s how you can create a bar chart to visualize the fire call counts across neighborhoods:

Run the SQL Query: Execute the query from the previous step to retrieve fire call counts for each neighborhood.

```sql
SELECT `Neighborhood` AS neighborhood, 
       COUNT(`Neighborhood`) AS count 
FROM fireCalls 
GROUP BY `Neighborhood`
ORDER BY count DESC;
```
### Access the Visualization Tool:

In the query results table, locate the plus sign (+) at the top-left corner of the result table.
Click the plus sign and select Visualization from the dropdown.

### Customize the Visualization:

In the visualization editor, choose Bar Chart as the chart type.
Configure the x-axis to display neighborhood and the y-axis to display count.
Adjust additional settings like sorting or labels for clarity.
### Generate the Chart:

After configuring, click Apply to generate the visualization.
The resulting bar chart provides a clear comparison of fire call counts across various neighborhoods, allowing you to identify high-incident areas at a glance.
