## About the Dataset

Provider fraud is a significant challenge facing Medicare, leading to increased healthcare costs. Fraudulent activities such as billing for services not provided, duplicating claims, and misrepresenting services are common. This organized crime impacts both insurance companies and beneficiaries, as it drives up insurance premiums and overall healthcare costs.

### Project Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to predict potentially fraudulent providers based on the claims they file. In addition, we aim to identify key variables that can help detect patterns of fraudulent behavior in claims, providing insights into the future actions of providers who may attempt to commit fraud.

### Types of Fraud by Providers

Common types of fraud include:

- **Billing for services not provided**.
- **Duplicate claims** for the same service.
- **Misrepresentation of services** provided.
- **Upcoding**: Charging for a more complex or expensive service than actually provided.
- **Billing for covered services** when the actual service provided was not covered.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to "predict potentially fraudulent providers" based on their claims data. This includes uncovering critical variables and identifying patterns that can indicate fraudulent behavior, helping in the detection and prevention of future fraud.

## Introduction to the Dataset

The dataset consists of three main components: Inpatient Claims, Outpatient Claims, and Beneficiary Details, each providing different insights into provider behavior.

### A) Inpatient Data

This subset contains information about claims filed for patients admitted to hospitals, including admission and discharge dates and primary diagnosis codes.

### B) Outpatient Data

This data covers claims for patients who visit hospitals without being admitted, providing details on services and treatments administered.

### C) Beneficiary Details Data

This dataset contains KYC (Know Your Customer) information about beneficiaries, such as health conditions

# Tables in the Dataset
## First Table `Train-1542865627584.csv`
- **Dimensions**: The dataset includes **5,410 rows** and **2 columns**.

Each row in this file represents a unique healthcare provider, while each column provides specific details about that provider. Below, we’ll take a closer look at each column and explain its role in identifying potential fraud.

## Columns and Data Types

| Column Name       | Data Type | Description                                                                                              |
|-------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Provider**      | Text      | A unique identifier for each healthcare provider. This allows us to track specific providers across datasets and analyze their claim patterns over time. |
| **PotentialFraud** | Text    | Indicates whether a provider is suspected of fraud. This column likely contains values like `"Yes"` or `"No"`, labeling each provider as either potentially fraudulent or legitimate. |

# Tables in the Dataset

## Second Table: `Train_Beneficiarydata-1542865627584.csv`
- **Dimensions**: The dataset includes **138,556 rows** and **25 columns**.

Each row in this file represents information about a beneficiary, with specific attributes related to their demographics, chronic conditions, and insurance reimbursements. These details can be instrumental in identifying patterns or trends that may be associated with potential fraudulent activities. Let’s explore each column and its role in fraud analysis.

## Columns and Data Types

| Column Name               | Data Type | Description                                                                                              |
|---------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **BeneID**                | Text      | A unique identifier for each beneficiary, allowing us to link claims and medical records across datasets. |
| **DOB**                   | Date/Time | The date of birth of the beneficiary, which is used to determine age-related patterns in claim activities. |
| **DOD**                   | Date/Time | Date of death, if applicable, which is essential for checking claims made after death, a common fraud indicator. |
| **Gender**                | int64     | The gender of the beneficiary, useful for demographic analysis and identifying population-specific trends. |
| **Race**                  | int64     | The racial background, which might be analyzed to understand any demographic-specific patterns in claims. |
| **RenalDiseaseIndicator** | Text      | An indicator of whether the beneficiary has renal disease, used to understand the need for certain high-cost treatments. |
| **State**                 | int64     | The state code of residence, helpful for identifying geographic trends and regional fraud hotspots. |
| **County**                | int64     | The county code of residence, which aids in further granular geographic analysis. |
| **NoOfMonths_PartACov**   | int64     | Number of months with Part A (hospital insurance) coverage, indicating insurance stability over time. |
| **NoOfMonths_PartBCov**   | int64     | Number of months with Part B (medical insurance) coverage, also useful for understanding coverage history. |
| **ChronicCond_Alzheimer** | int64     | Indicates if the beneficiary has Alzheimer's disease, one of several chronic conditions monitored. |
| **ChronicCond_Heartfailure** | int64  | Indicates if the beneficiary has heart failure. Chronic conditions are key factors in claim analysis. |
| **ChronicCond_KidneyDisease** | int64 | Kidney disease indicator, as renal treatments are often high-cost and require detailed analysis. |
| **ChronicCond_Cancer**    | int64     | Cancer status, essential for identifying claims related to oncology treatments. |
| **ChronicCond_ObstrPulmonary** | int64 | Indicator of obstructive pulmonary disease, another significant chronic condition in healthcare claims. |
| **ChronicCond_Depression** | int64    | Depression status, useful for mental health claims analysis. |
| **ChronicCond_Diabetes**  | int64     | Diabetes indicator, another prevalent chronic condition that can impact claim types and frequency. |
| **ChronicCond_IschemicHeart** | int64 | Ischemic heart disease indicator, relevant for cardiac treatment-related claims. |
| **ChronicCond_Osteoporasis** | int64 | Osteoporosis status, monitored for claims related to bone health treatments. |
