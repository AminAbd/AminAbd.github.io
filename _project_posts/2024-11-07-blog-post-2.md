## About the Dataset

Provider fraud is a significant challenge facing Medicare, leading to increased healthcare costs. Fraudulent activities such as billing for services not provided, duplicating claims, and misrepresenting services are common. This organized crime impacts both insurance companies and beneficiaries, as it drives up insurance premiums and overall healthcare costs.

### Project Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to predict potentially fraudulent providers based on the claims they file. In addition, we aim to identify key variables that can help detect patterns of fraudulent behavior in claims, providing insights into the future actions of providers who may attempt to commit fraud.

### Types of Fraud by Providers

Common types of fraud include:

- **Billing for services not provided**.
- **Duplicate claims** for the same service.
- **Misrepresentation of services** provided.
- **Upcoding**: Charging for a more complex or expensive service than actually provided.
- **Billing for covered services** when the actual service provided was not covered.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to "predict potentially fraudulent providers" based on their claims data. This includes uncovering critical variables and identifying patterns that can indicate fraudulent behavior, helping in the detection and prevention of future fraud.

## Introduction to the Dataset

The dataset consists of three main components: Inpatient Claims, Outpatient Claims, and Beneficiary Details, each providing different insights into provider behavior.

### A) Inpatient Data

This subset contains information about claims filed for patients admitted to hospitals, including admission and discharge dates and primary diagnosis codes.

### B) Outpatient Data

This data covers claims for patients who visit hospitals without being admitted, providing details on services and treatments administered.

### C) Beneficiary Details Data

This dataset contains KYC (Know Your Customer) information about beneficiaries, such as health conditions

# Tables in the Dataset
## First Table `Train-1542865627584.csv`
- **Dimensions**: The dataset includes **5,410 rows** and **2 columns**.

Each row in this file represents a unique healthcare provider, while each column provides specific details about that provider. Below, weâ€™ll take a closer look at each column and explain its role in identifying potential fraud.

## Columns and Data Types

| Column Name       | Data Type | Description                                                                                              |
|-------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Provider**      | Text      | A unique identifier for each healthcare provider. This allows us to track specific providers across datasets and analyze their claim patterns over time. |
| **PotentialFraud** | Text    | Indicates whether a provider is suspected of fraud. This column likely contains values like `"Yes"` or `"No"`, labeling each provider as either potentially fraudulent or legitimate. |
